                        Spent the first part of the week working on reasearching components for our Component Analysis assignment, specifically
						our microcontroller and single board computer (Raspberry Pi). Worked with Viktoryia on an initial state transition
						diagram for our microcontroller software required for the Software Overview assignment. Also worked with Viktoryia on
						setting up the TI SDK and was able to run a code snippet to blink an on-board LED. Lastly, read over comments from our
						last submission and made changes where needed.

                        This week I was responsible for the electrical overview assignment and spent a majority of my time looking at datasheets
                        and determining power requirements and standard protocols (UART, BLE). I was able to find a peripheral guide for our microcontroller that defines the Interrupt
                        Service Routines and other useful constants and funtions.
                        There was a specific example for configuring UART that we will use as a starting point.

                        This week I spent time researching packaging information for products similar to our project. There is a comparable Ring Doorbell that differes in function but
                        has an enclosure similar to our CAD design.

                        I worked with Viktoryia to set up a driver for the alphanumeric keypad. After that, we turned our focus to configuring the MSP432 for UART. Although
                        the microcontroller supports UART, it it still rather tricky to setup and debug. Using the Keysight InfiniiVision MSO-X 3014T
                        Oscilliscope, I was able to track down the sample transfer data sent out by the microcontroller. The picture shwows the waveforms
                        on the oscilliscope, with the bottom blue lines indicating a byte transfer. The red error lines were for the receiving end of
                        UART which were not considered during this test setup.


                        Next week I plan on testing the receiving side of UART on our microcontroller and try and configure the HC-05 bluetooth module
                        for our targeted 9600 baud rate. If that is tested and working, we can start communicating with the Raspberry Pi and begin fleshing out our system.

                        This week I was able to get the Hall effect sensor working on our bread board and show that the digitial output would
                        go from high to low when a magnet was close enough. I worked with Vikytoria on debugging UART and was able to show data being
                        sent out from the micro using the oscilliscope's segmenting capabilities. The team was able to get the microcontroller, the
                        bluetooth module, and the Raspberry Pi to communicate, and moving forward I will work on finalizing the embedded software for
                        the microcontroller.

                        I put in a purchase order for the microcontroller and bluetooth module so those should be in next week. With our main components
                        tested and communicating we can start making decisions on the system level. Next week I will be working on further testing the
                        bluetooth connection and figuring out how to best use interrupts in our event driven system.

                        This week I spent time re-working the keypad so it uses interrupts instead of polling. Also I spent time rewiring the connections
                        so that all of the GPIO outputs are on one port and all of the outputs are on another. Additionally I helped Yash with the Software
                        Formalization assignment by describing the different software functions the micro will implement and what needs to be tested. We received
                        the first order of parts I ordered last week.

                        Next week I plan on finishing up the keypad driver and start on writing the main system program. It will utilize all of the components we have
                        interfaced so far (bluetooth module, keypad, Hall effect sensor). Our group has a midterm design review on Monday and I imagine preparing
                        for that most of the weekend.

                        This week our team had our midterm design review. We had the first review slot and as such we spent the weekend preparing for our presentation.
                        I worked on pulling information from our previous assignment submissions into our slides and was responsible for assigning slides for members of
                        our team. Preparing for the presentation was pretty straight forward but still took time to organize everything into an informative and visually
                        appealing display.

                        Outside of preparing for the presentation, I spent some time on working with the MSP432 timer module. I was able to find some functions in the API
                        that will allow us to set off the timer interrupt at a predetermined period of time. The plan is to use this module to reset our system if there isn't
                        outside interaction after a specific time interval.

                        This next week I plan on wrapping up the keypad driver and timer module and start making the overall system software.

                            This week I spent time working with the various MSP432 timer modules. We need a module uses a capture compare value for when
                            a timeout occurs, which will be when the Raspberry Pi doesn't send a response in time or when the keypad is left unattended. For that
                            I plan on using the Timer32 module which is a 32-bit count down timer at 3Mhz (SMCLK) that should be fast enough and allow us to set speicific timeout
                            values. The other timer module will be the Timer A module. This timing module offers more flexibility and has an easy configuration.
                            Next week (after spring break) I will integrate the Timer32 module with the uart module to track how long responses are taking and make sure that characters are
                            not being sent out too quickly.

                            This week I was responsible for the legal analysis of our product. As such, I spent a good amount of time looking into certifications our
                            product would need in order to be marketed in the U.S. and Europe. This involved finding requirements for the FCC, RoHS and CE markings.
                            Patents with designs or ideas similar to ours were already presented in our initial project proposal, but claims for each needed to be
                            evaluated for the assignment.

                            I also spent time looking at the SysTick and Timer32 modules for the microcontroller. I found you could calculate time differences using
                            SysTick functions which will be used to prevent keypad debouncing. I worked with Ian on connecting a GPIO pin to the Bluetooth module as a way
                            to check to see if the module had a valid connection. This will help with the logic of our overall system design.

                            Next week I will integrate timers into the Bluetooth logic to make sure packets are sent out on time. I will plan on having the keypad worknig
                            and stepping through a simple locking mechanism while checking for interrupts. Some time will be spent at debugging as we start integrating more
                            and more components into the system.

                            This week I was able to get the keypad working finally. Using the print function was slowing down the interrupt being triggered and removing this
                            eliminated latency on button pressed. The system tick module helped figure out what was taking the most time. Further, the rows and columns from each
                            key pressed was mapped to each correspinding key. With this working, functions are being mapped for certain keys such as initiating the face capturing sequence.

                            I am working on integrating this with the UART funcationality, and hopefully we will be able to press a button, scan a face, and unlock the pushbar
                            in a correct sequence by the end of the week. I want to double check and make sure that UART is operating at the correct freqeucny and sending
                            correct data consistently. Next week I will wrap up most of the integration and begin debugging.

                            This week I worked on creating a state machine for the keypad that would allows locking and unlocking given a password
                            and special keys. I made a 5 character password and was able to use GPIO to toggle LEDs to indicate different states. This 
                            apparatus also used the timer to turn on LEDs for a certain period of time which is functionality that can be used for other
                            aspects of testing in our project. I wrote functions mapping special keys (some the alphabetical keys) which will trigger 
                            trigger a sequence to start facial recognition. By the end of this week we should be able to start the facial recognition 
                            sequence and get a response from the Raspberry Pi.

                            Next week I plan on integrating the keypad with the UART into our overall system algorithm and start testing different input scenarios.
                            This will involve random button presses during other events, delayed responses from the Raspberry Pi, and other potential points
                            of failure. I also plan on solidifying our software design to adhere to better software engineering practices, right now some of the 
                            code base is more or less a hacked together solution and needs to be cleaned up.

                                This week I spent some time digging through the MSP432 User Guide and Driver Library to find functions for verifying internal and
                                external clock frequencies. The micro supports a 48MHz external oscillator and it might be more reliable than the internal ones. These 
                                functions also verified that the subsystem clock was operating at 24Mhz which meant our UART module configuration was correct. I also ran
                                into problems with the keypad, for whatever reason the keypad was not reading in pin values correctly. I ended up moving some of the pin
                                connections on the breadboard and started getting reliable presses again.

                            <p>
                                I also worked on cleaning up the code we had as it wasn't very cohesive. This involved creating new files for the LEDs and a Lock file that 
                                abstracts the functionality of toggleing on GPIO and recording a sequences of button presses. This code is much easier to maintain and 
                                debug and will hopefully be beneficial moving forward. Unfortunately we weren't able to program our PCB yet, but we should be able to
                                figure it out in the next few days. Next week I will (hopefully) be debugging the code on our board. Everything seems to be coming together 
                                rather quickly.

                                    This week I worked on adding code such that the user can change his or her password by entering the current password, pressing a special key,
                                    then entering in a new password. We flashed the microcontroller on our PCB and were able to debug a small issue by configuring some of the pins
                                    to use pull down resistors instead of pull up resistors. I also added GPIO functions for locking the pushbar and for the Hall Effect sensor.
                                    We are successfully able to actuate the push bar when entering a correct locking sequence. Next week we should have a demo using bluetooth and 
                                    facial recognition able to demo and show a viable project. I will be continuing to test our micro code and tweak parameters to make sure the 
                                    timing is reliable and consistent. I learned how to solder this week and hopefully can solder on some components next week to help aleviate some
                                    of the work load from Yash and Vikytoria.
