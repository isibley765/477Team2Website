						our microcontroller and single board computer (Raspberry Pi). Worked with Viktoryia on an initial state transition
						diagram for our microcontroller software required for the Software Overview assignment. Also worked with Viktoryia on
						setting up the TI SDK and was able to run a code snippet to blink an on-board LED. Lastly, read over comments from our
						last submission and made changes where needed.

                    <p>This week I was responsible for the electrical overview assignment and spent a majority of my time looking at datasheets
                        and determining power requirements and standard protocols (UART, BLE). I was able to find a peripheral guide for our microcontroller that defines the Interrupt
                        Service Routines and other useful constants and funtions.
                        There was a specific example for configuring UART that we will use as a starting point.</p>
                        <p>Next, I plan on reviewing feedback on last weeks document and making changes based on TA feedback as well
                        as customizing some of the example code for the microcontroller.

                            This week I spent time researching packaging information for products similar to our project. There is a comparable Ring Doorbell that differes in function but
                            has an enclosure similar to our CAD design.
                        
                            I worked with Viktoryia to set up a driver for the alphanumeric keypad. After that, we turned our focus to configuring the MSP432 for UART. Although
                            the microcontroller supports UART, it it still rather tricky to setup and debug. Using the Keysight InfiniiVision MSO-X 3014T
                            Oscilliscope, I was able to track down the sample transfer data sent out by the microcontroller. The picture shwows the waveforms
                            on the oscilliscope, with the bottom blue lines indicating a byte transfer. The red error lines were for the receiving end of
                            UART which were not considered during this test setup.
                        
                        
                            Next week I plan on testing the receiving side of UART on our microcontroller and try and configure the HC-05 bluetooth module
                            for our targeted 9600 baud rate. If that is tested and working, we can start communicating with the Raspberry Pi and begin fleshing out our system.

                        This week I was able to get the Hall effect sensor working on our bread board and show that the digitial output would 
                        go from high to low when a magnet was close enough. I worked with Vikytoria on debugging UART and was able to show data being
                        sent out from the micro using the oscilliscope's segmenting capabilities. The team was able to get the microcontroller, the
                        bluetooth module, and the Raspberry Pi to communicate, and moving forward I will work on finalizing the embedded software for
                        the microcontroller. 
                        
                        I put in a purchase order for the microcontroller and bluetooth module so those should be in next week. With our main components
                        tested and communicating we can start making decisions on the system level. Next week I will be working on further testing the
                        bluetooth connection and figuring out how to best use interrupts in our event driven system.
