							<p> We revised our initial design proposal, and determined the basic functionality of our project, and determined
							what our microcontroller would be (MSP432), as well as assigning roles to the relevant people. In addition, we planned
							out our work schedule for meetings for the remainder of the semester.</p>

									<h1><b>Date:</b> January 18, 2019 </h1>
									<h1><b>Total hours:</b> 12 </h2>
									<h1><b>Description of Design Effors: </b></h1>
								</header>
								<p> This week, I was able to procure most of the materials we needed to proceed with out prototyping, such add
								the development board for out microcontroller (MSP432), the Bluetooth module, numeric keypad, Hall effect sensor, and
								Raspberry Pi. In the next week, we will begin prototyping every required module for our design. Along with the rest
								of the team, we narrowed the scope of our PSSC's and further explained the overall purpose they serve.</p>
								<p> In addition, I began considering the functional, software, power, and electronic constrains needed for our
								design to function properly. I will begin laying out the schematic in the next week as well. </p>

									<h2><b>Week 3: </b></h2>
									<h1><b>Date:</b> January 25, 2019 </h1>
									<h1><b>Total hours:</b> 13 </h2>
									<h1><b>Description of Design Effors: </b></h1>
								</header>
								<p> This week, my primary focus was on consolidating the information regarding the embedded hardware required for the design,
								so I put most of my time into determining how the hardware would function together. I finalized the choices of the development
								boards and breakout boards, most importantly with the Bluetooth module. In order to simplify the design, we decided to change
								one of our PSSC's, to reflect the decision to interface with Bluetooth from I2C to UART.</p>
								<p> I also installed the required softwares for electrical layouts, such as Autodesk Eagle and Ultra Librarian, and have begun
								laying out the first iteration of the board, as well as referencing datasheets to determine what kind of power requirements are
								needed for the components. I have begun making footprints for our MSP432 iteration for the PCB, since the one provided by Texas
								Instruments is out of date.</p>

									<h1><b>Date:</b> February 1, 2019 </h1>
									<h1><b>Total hours:</b> 15 </h2>
									<h1><b>Description of Design Effors: </b></h1>
								</header>
								<p> This past week, I put more time into the Eagle schematic, as well as refining the power electronics needed
								for each of the embedded components. I have all of the requisite footprints required to port the schematic to
								a PCB, and after a design review next week, will begin laying out the board.</p>
								<p> The other major thing I did was to dive into the motor interface for the door lock. After speaking at length
								with Todd about Allegion lock interface systems, I was able to actuate the lock with the desk power supply.
								In the coming week, I will try to get the full motor system integrated with the microcontroller and Hall effect sensor.
								Once this step is complete, we will be able to mount it to the door and begin laying out the wiring.</p>

									<h2><b>Week 5: </b></h2>
									<h1><b>Date:</b> February 8, 2019 </h1>
									<h1><b>Total hours:</b> 8 </h2>
									<h1><b>Description of Design Effors: </b></h1>
								</header>
								<p> I wasn't able to put in as much time with my specific tasks this week. Instead, I mostly helped other people
								with accomplishing their tasks, such as understanding the microcontroller interface, assisting with the mechanical
								overview, and helping formalize the software.</p>
								<p> More work was put into the EAGLE schematic, with the ultimate goal of finishing up the layout by Sunday. I have
								all of the symbols and most of the footprints laid out, and will endeavor to get most of the 3D models completed by
								next Friday.</p>
