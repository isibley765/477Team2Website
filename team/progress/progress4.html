											<p>Working on setting up the communication between the MSP432P401R microcontroller and the HC-05 Bluetooth chip through the UART interface.

										IDE project settings so it would work with the provided code. I was able to get the communication going between the chip and micro.   </p>
										<p> Also keeping the website up to date with the fixes that need to be made in order for it to look pretty and consistent.

												<p>Was working primarily on getting the microcontroller functioning with the rest of the hardware. I got the numberpad
												to work with the micro - it now receives the correct signal from the corresponding pressed button (Figure 5.1). I have made the circuit
											based on Todd's suggestion with the pull-down resistors in order for the micro to not catch any noise coming from the inputs. </p>
											<span class="image left"><img src="../../media/images/waves1.png" alt=""/> <h1> Figure 5.2: Debugging UART Waves</h1></span>
											<p> Have also worked on the data transmission between the micro and the HC-05 Bluetooth module through UART interface.
											I did set up code that initializes the UART interfacing and communication between the devices. I based all the code on the
												GitHub repository library that was created for this particular chip interfacing. I was able to also setup the analog debbugging
												circuit with KeySight Oscilloscope in the lab (Figure 5.2). It helped us to see whether the micro is sending correct data through the channel. </p>

										 <p>I also worked on the Mechanical Overview doccument where I compared the housing of the current products on the market with the Project
										 Device that we are building. Me and Yash have also worked on the cad model of the housing that we created in SolidWorks. </p>
										 <p>Finally, I keep maintaining the website to make sure it's up to date with all the documents and progress reports from every single Team member.</p>

												<p> So this week was mega productive. At first we were unable to get any meaningful data to be sent to and from the micro.
													It was very frustrating. Multiple attempts of reading stuff with Oscilloscope were not successful. Days passed filled with
													failures upon failures. But then I started attempting to connect to the Bluetooth Chip HC-05 with Raspberry Pi directly via
													the supported Bluetooth protocol on Pi and the PyBluz module we used earlier (terrible API and documentation, by the way).
													I was able to exculde the number of other different bluetooth modules in the room and find the one that belongs to our team.
													Basically, I was able to narrow the pool of MAC addresses down from 4 to the one and only we need. After mapping the MAC address,
													I started trying to send the data to the Bluetooth module and see how it would react. </p>
													<span class="image right"><img src="../../media/images/We_Love_Todd.jpeg" alt=""/> <h1> Figure 6.1: Oscilloscope Output in UART Viewing Mode</h1></span>
													<p> I had a lot of trouble figuring out the pace with which the characters are sent. First, they were really scarmbled so I knew that
														the baudrate was correct, something else was wrong. So I ended up putting a physical delay in the Python Script between the packages
														that are sent. I don't think it's a fault of the HC-05 chip, I believe it's PyBluz API that lacks functinality. </p>
													<p> I was able to check the data that was sent through the Bluetooth protocol from Pi to HC-05 chip via Oscilloscope probe
													connection in the UART debugging mode. It was a great success! (Figure 6.1) </p>
													<p> Fortunately, it's not the end of the whole deal here. I was able to also configure the micro to get that data from HC-05
													through the UART interface. So, now we have a fully functioning commuication line between the Pi, HC-05 and our micro.
												And we are happier than ever :)</p>

												<p> This week I was focusing more on figuring out the Microcontroller - Raspberry Pi communication  in terms of what one needs
												from the other. Me and Ian have talked throught the commuication patters that we are going to stick to throughout the development
											process from now on. We agreed that the micro has to send the boot signal to the pi in order to indicate low power mode exit. Also we have
										decided  that the  micro needs to know whether the server connection (where whole face recognition process happens) is lost in order to let
									the user know that the only options now are Mechanical or Keypad overrides.</p>
									<span class="image right"><img src="../../media/images/piBoot.png" alt=""/> <h1> Figure 7.2: Pi Console Output</h1></span>
									<p> I got the boot message to send to the pi (Figure 7.1) and get the correct responce (Figure 7.2), now we need to figure out whether we need Threading or simple interrupts for our micro in order to interface
									with the keypad and bluetooth chip at the same time. Me and Evan are going to be working on it further down the line as well. </p>
									<p> Overall, stuff I did this week goes off of the things I have accomplished last week with the Bluetooth connection. To recap, right now
									I am making the system come together and having proper commuication established between all the components. </p>

												</header>
												<p> This week we were working on the general API for the micro and Pi communication. Me and Ian were wrapping up things on that.
													We have integrated a better API that allows us to unlock the door when the face is recognised. These past few weeks were mostly
													focused on the PCB design which was primarily Yash's job. Next step is getting the PCB and starting the integration of the system.
