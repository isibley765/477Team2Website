            <h1 style="font-size: 20px"> This project implements <b> a smart-lock system </b>, which provides the user with three ways to gain access to the door. Firstly, there will be a camera which, when activated, will capture the face of the user. The information is processed on a Raspberry Pi, and if the number of images matched reach a certain threshold, the Pi sends an ACK/NAK signal to the microcontroller, which will activate the motor to unlock the door. In the event an unauthorized user wants to gain access to the lock, there is a number pad that can give access to the user. If other two methods are unsuccessful, we have decided to implement a mechanical override using a physical key. The reason we decided to implement this is that we needed a way to gain access regardless of the state of the electronics.
